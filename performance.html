<h2>Performance Computing</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
Concurrency and parallelism are two important concepts you must understand before you can create higher performance applications. You can use concurrency, multi-threading and parallelization to improve performance for critical processes and increase overall application throughput.</div>

  <p>concurrency vs parallel <br> execution</p>
</div>

<p>There are cases when you can use the same subprogram to process a lot of data in parallel. These are data oriented applications suitable for parallelism. In other case you can have many relative independent subprograms that can be executed concurrently or asynchronously preventing your applications to block itself waiting for resources. Both methods will improve performance and responsiveness of your application.</p>

<h2>Efficiency vs Performance</h4>

<p>You should know, efficiency is not the same thing as performance. You can improve efficiency by using better data structures and algorithms. You can improve performance by improving efficiency this way. You can also improve performance by using more processing power. This is not necessary efficient, since you consume more power.</p>

<p>Multi-threading can have significant waste. You should actually use single thread applications most of the time. Multi-thread applications are difficult to build, hard to maintain and most of the time less efficient than single threaded applications.</p>

<h2>Amdahl’s Law</h2>

<p>The theoretical performance gain can be calculated by following the rule which is referred to as Amdahl’s Law. This law establish that there will always be a maximum speedup that can be achieved when the execution of a program is split into parallel threads.</p>

<pre><code class="language-output">
 S(n) = 1 / (1 - P) + P/n
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>S(n) is the performance achieved by using n cores or threads.</li>
<li>P is the fraction of the program that can be parallelized.</li>
<li>(1-P) is the fraction of the program that must be serial.</li>
</ul>

<p>We study parallel processing in Software Engineering course. If you are interested to find details you can study Bash scripting. In this article we will focus on multi-threading.</p>

<h2>Level of parallelism</h2>

<ul>
<li>Multi-processing: Multiple Processors/CPUs executing concurrently. This unit here is a CPU. You need a multi-core CPU or a machine with many CPUs to achieve this.</li>

<li>Multi-tasking: Multiple tasks/processes running concurrently on a single CPU. The OS executes these tasks by switching between them very frequently. This unit here is a Process. </li>

<li>Multi-threading: Multiple parts of the same program running concurrently. In this case, we go a step further and divide the same program into multiple parts/threads and run those threads concurrently. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Processes vs Threads</h2>

<p>Let's make distinction between definition of terms. Understanding the definition will improve our ability to chose between methods of parallelization:</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>A process is a job that execute a program. A job has its own address space, a call stack, and handlers to resources such as open files or internet connections. A computer system normally has multiple processes running at a time. The OS keeps track of all these processes and facilitates their execution by sharing the processing time of the CPU among them.</p>

<h3>Thread</h3>

<p>A thread is a logical path of execution within a process. Every process has at least one thread called the main thread. This can create additional sub-threads. All threads created by a process share the same resources including memory and open files. Every thread has its own call stack created at runtime.</p>


<h2>Multi-Process</h2>

<p>One strategy for parallelization is to split data and create multiple processes that run in parallel using multiple Java instances. This strategy works well with system languages like C, Fortran, Rust, Nim not for Java. JVM needs time to load and can occupy large amount of memory to be loaded multiple times. </p>

  <p>Parallel System</p>
</div>

<p>I have worked with a code-base for Nokia that was using system multi-process parallelization to process digital maps for different regions. This solution was causing memory issues and overall low efficiency. Balancing the server was done by using a job scheduler but the process was difficult to control.</p>

<p>When you use Java multi-threading with process parallelization the result can be disastrous. Instead of gaining performance you can jam the server. Choking a server lead to frustration of entire team and eventually can have catastrophic consequences.</p>


<h3>Benefits of Multi-processing;</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Higher throughput;</li>
    <li>Code is relative simple;</li>
    <li>Easy to debug using single thread</li>
    <li>You can switch from single to multi;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Problems of Multi-processing</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Takes more memory to run;</li>
    <li>Inter-process communication is difficult;</li>
    <li>Can lead to resource depletion;</li>
    <li>You may need many database licenses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multi-threading</h2>

<p>Multi-threading is realized in a process. Before diving in examples let's review the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy. Maybe you don't need to learn this if you don't actually need it for your project.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Multi-threading;</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Higher throughput;</li>
    <li>More responsive applications;</li>
    <li>More efficient utilization of resources;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems of Multi-threading</h3>

<ul>
    <li>More difficult to find bugs;</li>
    <li>The higher cost of code maintenance;</li>
    <li>More demand on the system;</li>
    <li>You can use a single database license;</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Warning:</b> Due to these major disadvantages we advice you to create a single thread model for your entire system. After testing, you can identify the bottlenecks. You need to parallelize only critical parts of a system to achieve best efficiency/performance balance.</div>

#Java 2d arrays

The difference between a 2D array and a regular array is that in a 2D array there are 2 dimensions height (columns) and width (rows). 
Imagine that you have a series of 1D arrays, one stacked on top of the other.
On each row you have an array made up of however many elements. Each element exists in a column.

The class "PerformanceSeating" is able to fill seats, make them available and print a representation to console.
It is also able to tell the user how many booked/available seats there are.
